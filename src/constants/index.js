export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a specialized Backend & Automation Engineer with a profound focus on intelligent systems and scalable infrastructure. I bridge the gap between robust backend architecture and Machine Learning, with deep expertise in PyTorch, YOLO, and ResNet architectures. My work spans from architecting high-performance FastAPI ecosystems to deploying containerized services via Kubernetes, always with a commitment to zero-downtime CI/CD and exceptional user experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Backend developer at Yupcha, where I specialize in the intersection of automation, machine learning, and scalable cloud infrastructure. I design and build highly-efficient APIs, autonomous data pipelines, and intelligent computer vision systems using PyTorch and YOLO.

With a strong foundation in ResNet architectures and DevOps practices (Docker, Kubernetes), I focus on creating systems that are not just scalable, but also self-optimizing. I thrive on solving complex backend challenges and integrating ML models into production-grade environments with a focus on reliability and performance.`;
